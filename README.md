# Grocery Management using Java Swing
This project is made using Java Swing Library. After compiling, it generates a class file that can be run on any operting system that has java run time. The application uses apache poi to read and write data from the excel file. No database is connected and the entire data storage happens only in the excel file. 
# Why not use a database?
The point of this was to make it easier for small vendors to manage their data using excel. Since maintaining a database is a bit of a hassle and data cannot be shared across multiple computers easily, Hence it made logical sense to use the local file storage system.
